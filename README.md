# 100 Days of Machine Learning 

Welcome to my **100 Days of Machine Learning** repository! This repository contains all my practice files and notes as I follow along with CampusX "100 Days of ML" playlist on YouTube. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and provide useful resources for anyone else who is also following this playlist or looking to learn machine learning.

## About the Playlist

The "100 Days of ML" playlist by CampusX is an extensive series designed to teach machine learning from scratch. Each day focuses on different topics ranging from basic concepts to advanced techniques in machine learning and deep learning.

You can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH).

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by days, each corresponding to a video from the playlist. Each folder contains:
- **Notebook files** (`.ipynb`): Jupyter notebooks with code and explanations.
- **Data files**: Any datasets used in the exercises.
- **Notes**: My personal notes and summaries of the concepts covered.
